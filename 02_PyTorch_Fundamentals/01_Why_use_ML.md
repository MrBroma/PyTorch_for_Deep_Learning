# When to Use Machine Learning?

## Why Not Use Traditional Programming?
- Writing explicit rules for **complex problems** is impractical.
- Example: **Self-driving cars**
  - Thousands of driving rules needed.
  - Hard to manually define all possibilities.

## Why Machine Learning?  
- ML **automates pattern discovery** from data.  
- Example: Convert **driving data** into numbers â†’ ML finds driving rules.  
- ML can be applied to **anything that can be represented as numbers**.

## Should You Always Use ML?  
- No! **Googleâ€™s Rule #1 for ML**:  
  - If a **simple rule-based system** works, **use it instead**.  
  - ML is powerful but **not always necessary**.  
  - Example: Cooking recipes (simple steps work better than ML).  

## Key Takeaways  
- ML is great for **complex, data-driven problems**.  
- Use **traditional programming** when possible.  
- ML **isn't a solution for everything**.  
- Next: What **Deep Learning** is good for! ðŸš€
