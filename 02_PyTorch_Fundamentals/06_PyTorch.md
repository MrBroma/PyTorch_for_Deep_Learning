# Introduction to PyTorch

In this video, we’ll explore **PyTorch**, its capabilities, and why it’s widely used in deep learning research.

## What is PyTorch?
**PyTorch** is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks for research and production. It allows you to write efficient **machine learning code in Python**, with **GPU acceleration**.

### Key Features:
- **Fast Deep Learning Code**: PyTorch makes it easy to write efficient machine learning models, especially when using **GPUs**.
- **[Torch Hub](https://pytorch.org/hub/)**: Provides access to pre-trained deep learning models, useful for **transfer learning**.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: PyTorch supports the entire **machine learning pipeline**, from **data preprocessing** to **model deployment**.

Originally developed by **Facebook** (now **Meta**), PyTorch is **open-source** and is used by major companies like **Tesla, Microsoft, and OpenAI**.

## Why PyTorch?
1. **The Most Popular Deep Learning Framework**  
   PyTorch is the leading framework for deep learning research. According to [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/trends), **58% of machine learning research papers** use PyTorch (as of December 2021).
   
2. **[Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/)**  
   This site tracks the latest machine learning breakthroughs and provides code implementations, many of which use PyTorch.

3. **Companies Using PyTorch**:
   - **Tesla**: PyTorch is used for **computer vision models** in **autopilot**.  
     - Watch **Andrej Karpathy's talk** (Tesla’s AI director) on **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=pytorch+tesla)**.
   - **OpenAI**: OpenAI has **standardized PyTorch** for its AI models.  
     - Read their **[official blog](https://openai.com/research/standardizing-on-pytorch)**.
   - **Microsoft**: PyTorch is integrated into **Azure Machine Learning** and other AI services.
   - **Agriculture**:  
     - PyTorch is used in agricultural robotics for **object detection**.  
     - Read the Medium article **[Agricultural Robots Use PyTorch](https://medium.com/@pyimagesearch/using-pytorch-for-agriculture-robotics-f6d3c42d2456)**.

4. **Why is PyTorch a research favorite?**  
   - **Andrej Karpathy** (Tesla) and **François Chollet** (creator of Keras) highlight its effectiveness.  
   - **[François Chollet’s tweet](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1079062839352004608)** explains how PyTorch and Colab made AI more accessible.

5. **PyTorch is Used by AI Giants**:
   - [Meta AI (Facebook)](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/pytorch-builds-the-future-of-ai-and-machine-learning-at-facebook/)
   - [Microsoft and PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/blog/microsoft-pytorch-ecosystem/)
   - [Tesla and PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/blog/tesla-autopilot-pytorch/)

## GPU and TPU Acceleration
- **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**  
  - A GPU is designed for massively parallel computations, making it perfect for deep learning.
  - PyTorch uses **[CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone)** to run machine learning code on **Nvidia GPUs**.
  
- **TPU (Tensor Processing Unit)**  
  - **TPUs** are specialized chips designed to **accelerate** tensor computations.
