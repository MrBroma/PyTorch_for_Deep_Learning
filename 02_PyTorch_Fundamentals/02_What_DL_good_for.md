# When to Use Deep Learning?

## Best Use Cases for Deep Learning  
- **Problems with long lists of rules** (e.g., self-driving cars).  
- **Continually changing environments** (ML models can adapt).  
- **Large datasets** (Deep Learning excels at pattern discovery).  
- Example: **Food 101 Dataset** â€“ Recognizing 101 different foods requires complex rules.

## When NOT to Use Deep Learning?  
- **Need for explainability** (DL models are complex, hard to interpret).  
- **Traditional approach works better** (Googleâ€™s Rule #1: Use simple rule-based systems when possible).  
- **Errors are unacceptable** (DL is probabilistic, not always predictable).  
- **Limited data** (DL often requires large datasets, but exceptions exist).  

## Key Takeaways  
- DL is powerful for **complex, large-scale, evolving problems**.  
- If a **simple rule-based system works, use it instead**.  
- ML & DL are similar but **DL is data-hungry & less explainable**.  
- Next: ML vs. DL based on **different types of data**! ðŸš€
