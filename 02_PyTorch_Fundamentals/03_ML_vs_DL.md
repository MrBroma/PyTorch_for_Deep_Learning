# Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning  

## Key Differences  
- **Machine Learning (ML)** → Best for **structured data** (rows & columns).  
  - Example: **Gradient Boosting Machines (XGBoost)**, a popular algorithm for structured datasets.  
- **Deep Learning (DL)** → Best for **unstructured data** (text, images, audio).  
  - Example: Neural Networks process data that lacks a clear tabular structure.  

## Examples of Structured vs. Unstructured Data  
| **Type**         | **Example** | **Best Approach** |
|-----------------|------------|------------------|
| Structured Data  | Spreadsheets, databases | **XGBoost, Random Forest** |
| Text            | Tweets, articles, chat logs | **Neural Networks** |
| Images          | Photos, medical scans | **CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)** |
| Audio           | Speech recognition | **RNNs, Transformers** |

## Common Algorithms  
### **Machine Learning (Structured Data)**  
- **Random Forest**  
- **Gradient Boosted Models (XGBoost)**  
- **Naïve Bayes**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  

### **Deep Learning (Unstructured Data)**  
- **Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN)**  
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** → Images  
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** → Sequential data (e.g., speech, text)  
- **Transformers** → State-of-the-art in NLP and AI  

## Final Thoughts  
- **Deep Learning = Many layers of algorithms** (more complex models).  
- **ML vs. DL isn't absolute** – sometimes both can be applied to a problem.  
- **Next:** What are **Neural Networks?** (Google this before the next lesson!).
