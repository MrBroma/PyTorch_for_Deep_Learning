# Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch

## Course Introduction

- Instructor: Daniel
- Course: Deep Learning with PyTorch
- PyTorch symbol: A flame (torch ðŸ”¥)

## What is Deep Learning?
- Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning.
- Focuses on **practical implementation** rather than just definitions.
- Uses **code** to manipulate data and discover patterns.

## What is Machine Learning?
- Machine Learning (ML) converts various types of **data** (images, text, numbers, video, audio) into **numbers**.
- The goal: **Find patterns** in these numbers using algorithms.
- **How?** Using **code and math**.
- This course is **code-focused** (not deep mathematical theory).
- Extra resources will be provided for deeper math understanding.

## AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** â†’ Broad field including all intelligent algorithms.
- **Machine Learning (ML)** â†’ Subset of AI focused on pattern recognition.
- **Deep Learning (DL)** â†’ Subset of ML using **neural networks** to model complex relationships.
- PyTorch can be used for **both** Machine Learning & Deep Learning.

## Traditional Programming vs Machine Learning

### Traditional Programming
- You write explicit rules to transform **inputs** into **outputs**.
- Example: Cooking a **roast chicken**.
  - **Inputs**: Vegetables, chicken.
  - **Rules**: Cut vegetables, season chicken, preheat oven, cook, etc.
  - **Output**: Cooked roast chicken.

### Machine Learning
- Instead of defining rules manually, the algorithm **learns the rules** from data.
- Given **inputs** and **desired outputs**, ML finds the hidden relationships.
- Example: A model learning how to cook a **roast chicken** by analyzing multiple recipes and outputs.
- This approach is called **Supervised Learning**:
  - **Inputs** = Features (ingredients, preparation steps)
  - **Outputs** = Labels (final dish)
  - **Algorithm** finds the best way to map inputs â†’ outputs.

## Key Takeaway
- **Machine Learning automates rule discovery** rather than manually coding rules.
- This course will focus on implementing these concepts **hands-on with PyTorch**.

## Reflection Question
- Why use Machine Learning/Deep Learning instead of traditional programming?
- Consider:
  - Can manually coding rules become too complex?
  - Are there patterns too intricate for explicit programming?
